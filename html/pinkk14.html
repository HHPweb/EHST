	<p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
	My day is never the same. I schedule what locations I would like to visit each day and there's always something unique, new or interesting (or all three) about each inspection! There's lots of opportunity for training and building skills, both interpersonal and technical.</p>

	<p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
	When I started working at Durham County I was already familiar with some items like HACCP, food safety and regulations from courses in the MSEH program, so I had a good base to work off of. I think choosing a topic for my professional paper that required me to speak with and interview strangers about health and safety was helpful as well since that is what I do every day now. My ECU EH education gave me a leg-up in my career as an EH Specialist because with an EH degree, your state internship requirement is only one year instead of two (all other degrees with 30 semester hours of science are required to do two years) and it prepared me to take the state board [REHS] exam which covers topics like waste water management which aren't part of my scope on a daily basis but are part of the scope of a registered environmental health specialist. I passed on my first attempt and there's a 50% failure rate! It's hard!</p>
