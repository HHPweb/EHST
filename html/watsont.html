  <h4>Tony Watson &#39;94</h4>
  
  <p><strong>Career: </strong>President, Workplace Hygiene Inc., an industrial hygiene consulting firm based in Greensboro, NC that provides comprehensive consulting services to clients in the U.S. and internationally; services include air and noise monitoring in a wide variety of industrial and non-industrial workplaces to help protect worker health.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Credentials: </strong>Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) and Certified Safety Professional (CSP)</p>
  
  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current EH job?</strong><br>
    I manage a staff of 5 Certified Industrial Hygienists and provide industrial hygiene consulting services for our clients.  More recently, I have consulted and testified in legal cases regarding exposures to hazardous substances in the workplace.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    There is so much to learn.  I have been an Industrial Hygienist for 20 years and I am still learning.  The variety of exposures we evaluate keeps things interesting. It is also rewarding to identify and fix problems that could negatively impact peoples&#39; health.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
    The Environmental Health program at ECU provided me with a broad, solid foundation to get started.  When I began working, I quickly realized that ECU had done a great job of preparing me for career in industrial hygiene because I either knew what my co-workers and superiors were asking of me or I knew where to find the information needed to do the job.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What advice do you have for students considering EH as a degree?</strong><br>
    You need to enjoy science.   The umbrella of Environmental Health encompasses many different professions.  Industrial Hygiene is just one of them.  It is worth your time to look into the variety of careers that are available in Environmental Health to see if one of them is right for you.</p>
