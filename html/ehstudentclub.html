  <p>The ECO-Pirates for Sustainability are a student-led organization at East Carolina University interested in improving sustainability and environmental awareness on campus and throughout the Greenville community.</p>
  
  <p>We meet every other Monday at 5:00 PM in MSC 233. If locations/dates/times change, members will be notified via e-mail and/or the ECO-Pirates for Sustainability Facebook page. Dues are $10 per semester.</p>
  
  <p>We participate in on-campus events every year like Get a Clue, Barefoot on the Mall, and the Youth Arts Festival. We also volunteer with other environmental organizations in Greenville, such as FROGGs (Friends of the Greenville Greenway). Clean ups on the Tar River, trips to Mother Earth Brewery in Kinston, tie-dye fundraisers, and Freeboot Friday are just a few of the things you&apos;d get to do as an ECO-Pirate. We offer many opportunities to obtain service hours while making a difference in our campus and community.</p>
