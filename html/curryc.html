  <h4>Chelsea Curry &#39;13</h4>
  
  <p><strong>Career: </strong>Environmental, Health, and Safety Coordinator at <a href="http://www.tyson.com" target="_blank">Tyson Foods, Inc.</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current EH job?</strong><br>
    My main job function is to manage the safety program elements to maintain compliance with NCDOL [NC Department of Labor], DOT [Department of Transportation], and NCDEQ [NC Department of Environmental Quality] requirements for a World Class Commercial Bakery. I've had the opportunity to work with regulatory agencies during audit processes. In addition, I have had opportunity to learn how different departments have to work together to ensure the safety and health of the environment, people, and property. Although, I would have to say that the best responsibility that I have is to attend various trainings in order to earn certifications related to the EH&amp;S field.

  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    I like how this career field is challenging, rewarding, and every day is completely different from the one before.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
    I believe my ECU EH education prepared me exceptionally well--so well, in fact, that I was honestly prepared for many more jobs than "just" an Environmental Health specialist. This is noted by the fact that, although my title includes Environmental Health, I was hired for a role that is more safety oriented than anything else. In addition, I could have easily have applied for jobs related to industrial sanitation or food safety and quality assurance and felt very confident during the interview process because of the knowledge I gained in those areas during my time as an EH undergraduate.
