  <p><strong>Where did you do your internship?</strong><br>
    My internship was in Bunbury, Australia, and the organization I worked with was a non-profit wildlife conservation park.  The funds came from Australian government and donations.  Even the donations were EH-related.  For example, the fruits and vegetables needed to feed the wildlife came from a local food bank that could not sell the produce to the public anymore due to an expiration date.  So instead of the produce going to waste, it was able to be used and conserve landfill space.

  <p><strong>What were your responsibilities as an intern?</strong><br>
    My role during this internship was assisting the on-duty wildlife officer in all aspects.  My responsibilities were to perform daily routes of feeding all animals throughout the wildlife park, as well as maintaining the exhibits and enclosures.  Some of the daily maintenance activities of the enclosures included: hosing down/raking fecal matter (depending on animal species) to prevent disease, scrubbing water bowls and providing fresh water, and providing new branches for birds to nest in.  Each species requires specific care when it comes to diet, so one of my duties was to prepare and wash the dishes.  During the dish washing, I would use one sponge for produce and a different sponge for meat to prevent cross contamination from occurring.  Daily grounds maintenance were needed, but varied.  Some days would consist of draining the duck pond and scrubbing to prevent disease, and other days would consist of pruning tree branches (which would then be recycled into the animal exhibits).

  <p><strong>What did you like most about your internship experience?</strong><br>
    I was blessed to have my internship in Australia, which is unlike most internships, so I was able to experience and learn from a different culture, while becoming more educated on environmental health.  I really enjoyed working outdoors daily; additionally, my favorite part of the experience was working hands-on with wildlife (i.e. exotic animals), while incorporating and performing environmental sustainability and health tasks.

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for this internship?</strong><br>
    I was able to apply knowledge from previous classes in order to relate my daily activities to environmental health and science topics.  Little details such as spotting a rain barrel and asking the staff what the water is used for once it is collected was very important to me.  Another little detail I already knew about was disinfection, so diluting vinegar to the right concentration for disinfecting bird feeder stands was simple to understand.  Overall, I was able to apply countless tasks with my education through ECU EH.
