  <h5>Why choose Environmental Health as a career?</h5>
  
  <img src="/cs-hhp/hlth/ehst/customcf/images/BSEH_home_1.jpg" alt="environmental health student conducting field research">
  
  <p>Prospects for employment for the environmental health graduate are excellent. Both public and official concern with environmental health problems remains high and legislation continues to create new opportunities in the field. The possible occupations open to the person with a degree in Environmental Health Sciences are many and diverse. Graduates can begin their professional careers as entry level environmental health scientists, industrial hygienists, and loss prevention officers.</p>
  
  <p>Employers include industry, academic institutions, health and regulatory agencies at the local, state or federal level. In addition, work as an environmental health consultant to private and public groups is open to graduates, as are such specialized assignments as a Health Officer on cruise ships or in international health programs. Many graduates have accepted commissions in the <a href="http://www.usphs.gov/" target="_blank">United States Public Health Service</a>. A number of graduates go on to graduate studies and find greater specialization in one of the many aspects of environmental health practice. Finally, some graduates decide to pursue careers in medicine and dentistry. </p>
  
  <p>In North Carolina, the starting annual salary for environmental health graduates ranges from $35,000 to $47,000. Regional salaries are comparable. The upper limit on salaries ranges from $47,000 to $150,000+ depending on the final level of professionalism reached.</p>
  
  <h5>Why choose ECU EHS Program?</h5>
  <img id="ehac_logo" src="/cs-hhp/hlth/ehst/customcf/images/EHAC_Logo.png">
  <ul>
    <li>The BS Environmental Health program is accredited by the <a href="http://www.ehacoffice.org/" target="_blank">National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council</a> (EHAC).  Such accreditation makes our students eligible to apply for great internship and scholarship opportunities that are only available for EHAC-accredited programs, and makes our graduates eligible for appointment in the U.S. uniformed services (e.g. US Public Health Service, US Navy).</li>
    <li>Our <a href="/cs-hhp/hlth/EHST/facultyehst.cfm">EHS faculty members</a> have many years of experience and certifications in their own field of expertise as practitioners and/or researchers.  Students receive hands-on training in the laboratory and in the field.</li>
    <li>BSEH students have opportunities for <a href="/cs-hhp/hlth/ehst/bseh-research.cfm">research experience</a> through involvement in faculty research projects and ECU-funded undergraduate research projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Environmental Health Sciences Curriculum</h5>
  
  <p>The curriculum provides an education in the liberal arts as well as the technical training needed to become an environmental health scientist. The curriculum consists of two phases: the first two years are preparatory, during which the general education requirements for a baccalaureate degree are met, and those courses that are required as background for the second phase of the program can be taken. The junior and senior years make up the professional phase of the program, with course work taken in the specialty.  Required core courses include: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Biology</li>
    <li>Chemistry</li>
    <li>Physics</li>
    <li>Organic Chemistry</li>
    <li>Microbiology</li>
    <li>Physiology</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This educational background not only produces a competent entry level individual in the Environmental Health Sciences field, but allows a qualified student to pursue a graduate education in other fields including biology, chemistry, toxicology, medicine, dentistry or veterinary medicine.</p>

  <h5>Admissions</h5>
  
  <p>Students are encouraged to enter the University at the freshman level with a declared intent to major in Environmental Health. Whether admission is at the freshman level or by transfer, the Environmental Health program selects those individuals who seem best qualified for admission into the program.</p>
  
  <p>Environmental Health professionals work in a wide variety of settings. Almost all of these involve working with people. The practitioner must like people, have a concern to serve, and be able to translate scientific and technical information into clear and understandable language for educational, legal and general information.</p>
