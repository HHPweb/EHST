  <p><strong>Career: </strong>Exposure Scientist/ Analytical Chemist at <a href="http://www.rti.org/" target="_blank">RTI International</a>, a nonprofit research organization that conducts research including <a href="http://www.rti.org/page.cfm/Measurement_and_Monitoring" target="_blank">environmental measurement/ monitoring</a> and <a href="http://www.rti.org/page.cfm/Air_Quality" target="_blank">air quality</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current EH job?</strong><br>
    RTI is a nonprofit research organization.  We do research to improve the human condition.  Specifically, I work in human exposure assessment.  I have done work on environmental exposures to pollutants such as VOCs, carbonyls, pesticides, PAHs, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide for children and adults.  My involvement on these projects range from planning the field studies to recruiting participants, collecting samples, analyzing samples by HPLC, GCMS, or GCMS-TOF, and interpreting data.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    What I like most about my career are the ever changing projects that we get.  I&#39;m always learning something new and working with new people.  I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;ve stayed here for 17 years.  I know that the research we do will go towards changing laws and regulations regarding environmental exposures to pollutants.  One project I worked on recruited families that used a spot-on flea and tick treatment on their dog.  We collected urine samples from both the parent a child in the home to measure the amount of metabolized insecticide pre- and post-application to their dog.  Information like this helps the research community know what happens in real world settings and how much are people voluntarily exposing themselves to when using chemicals.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career? </strong><br>
    I think my ECU EH education helped my career by broadening all the sciences that I was required to take.  I was able to take classes in biology, chemistry, physics, air pollution, water quality, toxicology, etc.  I can honestly say that I can still relate what I do to all these classes.  I work side by side with experts in specific fields such as toxicologists, epidemiologists, aerosol engineers, etc.  I may not be an expert in those areas, but I help to contribute to the research to support the work they do.  </p>
