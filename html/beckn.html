  <h4>Nicole Beck &#39;14</h4>
  
  <p><strong>Career: </strong>Graduate student, M.S. Environmental Health Program, East Carolina University</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why did you choose EH as your career path?</strong><br>
   I chose environmental health as my career path after practicing the field in the Army as a Preventive Medicine Specialist.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What do you like most about your EH career?</strong><br>
    I started out in the military as a cook, and realized that it was not the career for me. I change fields and really fell in love with what all environmental health entails. I enjoy working with various types of facilities to ensure proper sanitation and hygiene practices are being followed to protect the population.</p>

    <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for graduate school and for your career?</strong><br>
      My BSEH from ECU prepared me for graduate school by helping me to develop better study skills with various assignments I completed throughout my courses. The various courses I studied also helped me by providing me with more EH knowledge than I had previously, helping me to excel in my courses. I have not started in the career field outside of the military, however my BS in Environmental Health has helped me bridge the gap between some of the regulations used by local/state agencies and those used by the military.
