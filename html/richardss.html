	<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Concord, NC</p>

	<p><strong>Education:</strong><br>
		BS Biology, ECU, 1998<br>
		MS Environmental Health, ECU, 2001<br>
		PhD Entomology, NCSU, 2005<br>
		Postdoctoral, Arbovirology, UFL/FMEL, 2008</p>

	<p><strong>What inspired her to choose Environmental Health:</strong> She took a practicum class that helped her find a job at the Craven County Health Department in New Bern, NC when she was in the MSEH program at ECU.  She did not precisely know what she wanted to study, but she was interested in the public health issues associated with vector borne disease, so Craven County is where she collected data for her MS thesis.  She was fortunate to be able to continue this work through my PhD program (NCSU), post-doctoral position (UFL), and current academic position at ECU.</p>

	<p><strong>Why she chose to teach at East Carolina:</strong> She received her BS and MSEH at ECU, and NC is her home.</p>

	<p><strong>How long she has taught Environmental Health at ECU:</strong>  Since Fall 2011.</p>

	<p><strong>What classes she teaches:</strong> Vector Borne Disease Ecology class and laboratory (undergraduate level); Independent Studies; Public Health Pests and Vector Borne Disease Class and Laboratory (graduate level); Professional Paper/Thesis Writing Series; Environmental Health Program Management and Law (undergraduate and graduate level). She is also an adjunct faculty member with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Brody School of Medicine, so she periodically teaches classes for Advanced Virology.</p>

	<p><strong>What she most enjoys about teaching:</strong>  She enjoys interacting with students and sparking their interest in research.</p>

	<p><strong>Her concentration within the Environmental Health field, as well as other involvement with the field:</strong>  She is a Medical Entomologist conducting research on vector-borne diseases that impact public health.  Her research program currently focuses on vector-virus interactions that will help develop tools to control vectors.  Management of vector-borne diseases depends heavily on suppression of vector populations; therefore, understanding underlying causes of vector competence is essential to improve risk prediction tools. She also studies tick/mosquito exposure in outdoor workers and the extent to which environmental factors affect the efficacy of protective clothing available to these workers.  Dr. Richards&apos; research uses a combination of laboratory and field methods to improve risk assessments and mitigation measures to protect public health.</p>
