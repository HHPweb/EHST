    <h4>Kelly Shook &#39;03</h4>

    <p><strong>Career: </strong>Health Sciences Coordinator at <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/oehs">East Carolina University (ECU) Environmental Health and Safety Office (EH&amp;S)</a></p>

    <p>&#34;I manage several health and safety programs, including the University&apos;s laboratory safety, grant review, clinical staff safety, ergonomics, as well as the internship program... With each program, I am able to assist our University community, keeping them safe and healthy, whether it&apos;s through ergonomic evaluations or laboratory practice. Every day brings a new challenge. There is so much new and exciting research conducted at ECU and I am fortunate enough to be involved, developing safety plans.&#34;</p>

    <p><strong>Career: </strong>Safety Manager at East Carolina University (ECU) <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/oehs">Environmental Health and Safety Office</a> (EH&amp;S)</p>

    <h4>R. Edwin Stott &#39;14</h4>

    <p><strong>Career: </strong>Community Health Services Administrator at <a href="http://www.forsyth.cc/PublicHealth/" target="_blank">Forsyth County Department of Public Health</a></p>

    <p>&#34;EH is a very broad science and in order to manage an Environmental Health program, the EH professional must have a good understanding of many sciences.  This program prepared me for a career in managing a program because of this bigger picture approach... This program taught me how to conduct research and not to jump too quickly to conclusions, but to base decisions on science.&#34;</p>

    <h4>Kathryn Pink &#39;14</h4>

    <p><strong>Career: </strong>Environmental Health Specialist at <a href="http://dconc.gov/government/departments-f-z/public-health/environmental-health" target="_blank">Durham County Department of Public Health</a></p>

    <p>&#34;My ECU EH education gave me a leg-up in my career as an EH Specialist because with an EH degree, your state internship requirement is only one year instead of two... and it prepared me to take the state board [REHS] exam which covers topics like waste water management which aren&apos;t part of my scope on a daily basis but are part of the scope of a registered environmental health specialist. I passed on my first attempt and it is hard!&#34;</p>

    <h4>Adam Mannarino &#39;15</h4>

    <p><strong>Career: </strong>Environmental Health Officer at <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/phoenix/" target="_blank">Phoenix Area Indian Health Service</a></p>

    <p>&#34;...One of the best things about this position is the opportunity to provide environmental health services to populations that greatly need it... The environmental health program at ECU is recognized by environmental health professionals as one of the best in the Nation. Because of this recognition I was recruited for my current position with the Indian Health Service and was recommended for appointment in the Public Health Service... Without the help, support and encourage of this program I would not be where I am today.&#34;</p>
