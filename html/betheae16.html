  <p><strong>Where did you do your internship?</strong><br>
    I am currently completing my internship at Mayne Pharma in Greenville, NC. Mayne Pharma is a pharmaceutical manufacturing company. They make pharmaceuticals at a large scale and also do contract work for R&amp;D drug compounds (to be sent to clinical testing sites). This requires a diligent and rigorous occupational safety program/team.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What were your responsibilities as an intern?</strong><br>
    I am currently interning with the safety department. I typically help with testing and certifying the eyewash/shower stations in various labs, upload needed safety data sheets to the online database, check AEDs, and also check the fire extinguishers. In addition, I periodically help with the disposal of hazardous waste. This entails going to the various labs and collecting/checking the waste and disposing of it in the hazardous waste shed, where the waste waits for pickup.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What did you like most about your internship experience?</strong><br>
    What I liked most about this internship experience is that it showed me what occupational safety is all about. I got to experience working in a safety program first hand.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for this internship?</strong><br>
    My ECU EH education really prepared me for this internship because I didn&apost have to take the time to learn all the acronyms (MSDS, AED, etc.) and I also knew what sort of controls are involved in safety (i.e., engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment [PPE]).
