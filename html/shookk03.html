  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current EH job?</strong><br>
  I manage several health and safety programs, including the University&apos;s laboratory safety, grant review, clinical staff safety, ergonomics, as well as the internship program. I also serve on the University&apos;s HazMat team.</p>


  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
  With each program, I am able to assist our University community, keeping them safe and healthy, whether it&apos;s through ergonomic evaluations or laboratory practice. Every day brings a new challenge. There is so much new and exciting research conducted at ECU and I am fortunate enough to be involved, developing safety plans. Through our internship program, I am able to mentor both undergraduate and graduate students, giving real-world experience as well as helping to prepare them for a career in environmental health.</p>

	<p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
	My undergraduate degree gave me the framework in which to build a focused graduate career. Each course and instructor provided an opportunity to learn and develop the required knowledge and skill in a variety of subject areas in environmental health. After deciding my path of interest, the program allowed me to expand my knowledge and experience through additional coursework, research opportunities, as well as an internship, to better develop my skills. The knowledgeable and experienced instructors provided me not only with in-depth material learned in the classroom, but also problem-solving skills and experience in the field.</p>
