	<p>The need to maintain a healthful and safe environment in the face of an expanding population and complex technological pressures is becoming increasingly important. This need is being met, in part, by environmental health scientists and professionals trained in a multidisciplinary manner.</p>

	<p>Environmental Health Scientists protect the quality of the air we breathe, the waters we drink and play in, the food that we eat, as well as the workplaces we work in. The Environmental Health Scientist&apos;s tasks include environmental surveillance and program management necessary to assure safe and healthy conditions in public and private water supplies, food and drug processing concerns, food serving establishment, waste disposal systems, industrial operations, recreational facilities and in our homes.</p>
