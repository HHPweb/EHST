	<p><strong>What inspired her to choose Environmental Health:</strong> She enjoyed her undergraduate courses and labs in Biology and was interested in pursuing a Masters&apos; Degree.  A colleague was currently enrolled in the EHST program and introduced her to the department.  She took a course as an undergraduate and fell in love with the program.  Environmental health enabled her to build upon her undergraduate degree and gain more knowledge and hands-on experience in the field.  She was fortunate in her pursuits of her degree to obtain an internship with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) and was hired upon graduation in 2003.</p> 

	<p><strong>Why she chose to teach at East Carolina:</strong> She has been employed by ECU EH&amp;S for 10 years with responsibilities in laboratory safety and industrial hygiene.  Due to a faculty change in 2012, she was asked to teach Chemical Safety.  Since chemical safety is one of her areas of practice, she believed that she could be of service to the students.  She wanted them to have a &quot;real world&quot; perspective on chemical safety, so she structured the course around her staff position.</p>

	<p><strong>How long she has taught Environmental Health at ECU:</strong>  Since Fall of 2012.</p>

	<p><strong>What classes she teaches:</strong> Chemical Safety and Introduction to Environmental Health.</p>

	<p><strong>What she most enjoys about teaching:</strong>  She enjoys relating her professional experience to students.  She is able to present everyday examples that she encounters at ECU EH&amp;S and relay that knowledge-base to students.  She believes it is important to not only learn the material in the classroom but also be able to learn problem-solving skills and gain experience in the field.  </p>

	<p><strong>Her concentration within the Environmental Health field, as well as other involvement with the field:</strong>  She has experience managing several Environmental Health programs including industrial hygiene and exposure monitoring, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, ergonomics, clinical staff safety, as well as the laboratory safety program, and grant review program.  She also supervises the EH&amp;S internship program.  </p>
