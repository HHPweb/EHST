  <p><strong>Where did you do your internship?</strong><br>
I completed my internship with Workplace Hygiene, which is an industrial hygiene consulting firm for many different industries, both nationally and internationally. Their home office is located in Greensboro, NC, but their clients are located around the nation and globe. They are part of a larger company called Workplace Group, which also employs occupational technicians, audiologists, occupational health nurses, ergonomists, safety professionals, and laboratory personnel. The firm covers a broad spectrum of occupational health and safety needs.
</p>

  <p><strong>What were your responsibilities as an intern?</strong><br>
    My job title was Junior Industrial Hygienist. I assisted Certified Industrial Hygienists with calibration of equipment, sampling, and report preparation. The types of sampling we conducted were air sampling, noise monitoring, respirator fit testing, pulmonary function testing, indoor air quality surveys, and heat stress monitoring.

  <p><strong>What did you like most about your internship experience?</strong><br>
    The most enjoyable part of my internship was being able to put to use the broad base of knowledge that I have acquired as a student here at ECU. Being able to apply what I have learned in real life industrial settings, identifying risks and recommending solutions, and ultimately creating a safer work environment for those that are exposed to that environment on a daily basis are all aspects that were fulfilling. Another enjoyable moment was when I received my offer letter from Workplace Hygiene for a full time salaried position with them upon graduation.

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for this internship?</strong><br>
    East Carolina&#39;s Environmental Health program gave me a broad base of knowledge that I utilized on a daily basis during my internship. One class in particular was Dr. Balanay&#39;s &#34;Introduction to Industrial Hygiene&#34; gave me insight into the career, as well as an understanding of what an industrial hygienist does. She provided hands on experience with equipment and because of her background as a CIH, was able to explain all the different types of sampling that are utilized, as well as answer any question with great detail.
