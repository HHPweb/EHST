  <p><strong>What do you like most about your job?</strong><br>
    The people in the Directorate for Public Health that I work in are very friendly, encouraging and helpful to help one another to get jobs completed, that makes coming to work every day a lot better!   I really enjoy working on a military base and able to incorporate industrial hygiene methods into the military work ethics.  One day I may be doing an onsite walkthrough survey at the air station with the ospreys and helicopters, the next day doing indoor air quality sampling at the hospital, and ending the week with lead wipe sampling at the armory.  Every day is a different and exciting day at the office, and you never know what to expect!</p>
    
    <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
      The first day of my Introduction to Environmental Health Sciences course, I knew I wanted to pursue a career with this degree.  This degree allows you to never have a normal workday at the office behind the computer.  My professors in the environmental health program and internship at the ECU Environmental Health and Safety Office allowed me to enhance my ability to work on multiple projects at one time, and to always make a deadline for a report or project.  My industrial hygiene and laboratory courses allowed me to have experience in working with the equipment and monitoring devices that we work with on a day to day basis at the office.
