    </ul>

    <p>&#34;I completed my internship with Workplace Hygiene, which is an industrial hygiene consulting firm for many different industries... My job title was Junior Industrial Hygienist. I assisted Certified Industrial Hygienists with calibration of equipment, sampling, and report preparation. The types of sampling we conducted were air sampling, noise monitoring, respirator fit testing, pulmonary function testing, indoor air quality surveys, and heat stress monitoring.&#34;</p>

    </ul>

    <p>&#34;My internship was at the Department of Human and Health Services (DHHS) of North Carolina in Raleigh, NC. I was referred to this particular location by NEHA [National Environmental Health Association] through their National Environmental Public Health Internship in 2015. At DHHS, I was able to learn new skills and gained more knowledge about environmental health, especially the food and lodging services, as well as the public health branch of the department, particularly in the Epidemiology department... I was able to experience how an Environmental Health professional spend their day. There are so many aspects in the EH field that I never knew about, and the internship absolutely helped me out with that.&#34;</p>

    </ul>

    <p>&#34;My role during this internship was assisting the on-duty wildlife officer in all aspects.  My responsibilities were to perform daily routes of feeding all animals throughout the wildlife park, as well as maintaining the exhibits and enclosures... I was blessed to have my internship in Australia, which is unlike most internships, so I was able to experience and learn from a different culture, while becoming more educated on environmental health.  My favorite part of the experience was working hands-on with wildlife (i.e. exotic animals), while incorporating and performing environmental sustainability and health tasks... I was able to apply knowledge from previous classes in order to relate my daily activities to environmental health and science topics.&#34;</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.maynepharma.com/" target="_blank">Mayne Pharma, Inc.</a>, Greenville, NC</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&#34;I typically help with testing and certifying the eyewash/shower stations in various labs, upload needed safety data sheets to the online database, check AEDs, and also check the fire extinguishers. In addition, I periodically help with the disposal of hazardous waste... My ECU EH education really prepared me for this internship because I didnâ€™t have to take the time to learn all the acronyms [e.g., MSDS, AED] and I also knew what sort of controls are involved in safety (i.e., engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment [PPE]).&#34;</p>
