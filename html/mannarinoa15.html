  <p><strong>Career: </strong>Environmental Health Officer at <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/phoenix/" target="_blank">Phoenix Area Indian Health Service</a></p>

  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current job?</strong><br>
  The goal of the Indian Health Service Division of Environmental Health Services (DEHS) is "to enhance the health and quality of all American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level by eliminating environmental related disease and injury through shared decision making and sound public health measures." To accomplish this goal I provide comprehensive direct environmental health services and technical services and assistance, training and collaboration to the 7 Tribes I am assigned and I provide support for Indian Health Service programs located in these communities.  My major environmental health focus areas are children&apos;s environmental health, food safety, healthy homes, vector borne and communicable diseases and safe drinking water. I also work with our District Office on injury prevention initiatives in my communities.  I also travel throughout the Reno District (which is comprised of parts of California, all of Nevada and Utah) and assist other staff with environmental health issues as needed. I really have no typical day of work/ assignments. This job is comparable to what a county or state environmental health specialist would do, but I am assigned to American Indian communities in Utah.</p>

  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
  "I have been recommended for appointment in the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service, which means I am dedicated to serving underserved populations throughout the United States. The opportunity to serve vulnerable populations as a Public Health Service Officer is quite a career experience that I highly recommend. I have learned and experienced so much in my short time here it is hard to just pick one.  I just started my environmental health career, but one of the best things about this position is the opportunity to provide environmental health services to populations that greatly need it. I really like talking with, working with and helping Tribal members on a daily basis. Actually seeing some of the changes I have made positively affect the community is a very rewarding experience. Working and living in the Rocky Mountain region of Utah is awesome. I am in awe every time I drive or go outside at the beauty of this place.  Getting to explore the 5 National Parks that Utah offers is really fun. Also getting to explore the Western United States has also been enjoyable. As a Public Health Officer, especially early in your career you have to take different assignments, which could mean moving and seeing different places you&apos;ve never been before."</p>

	<p><strong>How do you think your ECU MSEH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
	"My MSEH education at East Carolina University provided me with the tools, understanding, competence and confidence in environmental health to execute the duties of my job on a daily basis. I still learn new things every day, but this program laid a foundation of technical knowledge and experience in environmental health that I use to build on in my career. The faculty and staff of the MSEH program inspired and encouraged me to pursue my current career.  The environmental health program at ECU is recognized by environmental health professionals as one of the best in the Nation. Because of this recognition I was recruited for my current position with the Indian Health Service and was recommended for appointment in the Public Health Service. I still refer back to my classes and the activities and opportunities I participated during the MSEH program for guidance, support and ideas. The MSEH program has also prepared me to take the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) credential Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS/RS) exam. Without the help, support and encourage of this program I would not be where I am today."</p>
