  <p><strong>Where did you do your internship?</strong><br>
My internship was at the Department of Human and Health Services (DHHS) of North Carolina in Raleigh, NC. I was referred to this particular location by NEHA [National Environmental Health Association] through their National Environmental Public Health Internship in 2015. At DHHS, I was able to learn new skills and gained more knowledge about environmental health, especially the food and lodging services, as well as the public health branch of the department, particularly in the Epidemiology department.

  <p><strong>What were your responsibilities as an intern?</strong><br>
    I had no real title since most people knew me as an intern. Here is a brief summary of what I had to do during my internship:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I worked with both the Epidemiology and Food Protection branches.</li>
      <li>My duties included many tasks from both the Public Health and Environmental Health programs.</li>
      <li>Epidemiology works included various research projects, data collection, and critical analysis of prevalence diseases throughout NC so that a trend can be developed and studied.</li>
      <li>Food protection works included attending public meetings with the departmentâ€™s head, provided insights into the new Food Code changes in NC, and helped out with the variance applications and the variance committee.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <p><strong>What did you like most about your internship experience?</strong><br>
    The thing that I liked most about my internship is that I was able to experience how an Environmental Health professional spend their day. It was definitely exciting to witness how a normal day would go on for an EH professional. There are so many aspects in the EH field that I never knew about, and the internship absolutely helped me out with that.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for this internship?</strong><br>
    I think that my EH education at ECU helped me out a lot, especially when it comes to the tasks that I were assigned to do. My knowledge with food regulations and guidelines through the courses that I took at ECU definitely provided me with much needed information when I was completing my assigned tasks at DHHS. Overall, the internship made me realize that the classes I took do matter in the real world, and for that I am thankful.
