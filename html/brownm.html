  <p><strong>Career: </strong>Environmental Health and Safety Specialist at <a href="https://www.maynepharma.com/" target="_blank">Mayne Pharma, Inc.</a>, Greenville, NC</p>
  
  <p><strong>What are your responsibilities in your current EH job?</strong><br>
    My responsibilities include managing environmental permitting programs (waste water, storm water, air permit, hazardous waste); ensuring laboratory safety through inspections; providing trainings to employees as needed including forklift training, emergency equipment, hazard communication; identifying and correcting fire and life safety hazards through inspections and employee reports; complying with OSHA regulations; and creating a welcoming culture of occupational safety and health.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    I like most that my career is never the same. Some days I will sit at my desk all day working on reports, but without warning my day can change into rectifying a hazard that I noticed while walking back from lunch. There is always something to do and always something new to learn.</p>

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career and/or graduate school?</strong><br>
    &#34;My EHS degree has DRASTICALLY helped me in my career. With the exception of one or two classes, I am using information from the entire program almost daily. After working for a year, I decided to begin my graduate degree studies at ECU through the MS Occupational Safety program. My undergraduate classes continue to benefit me in the program since I had a good foundation of knowledge. I am set to graduate in December [2016].&#34;</p>
    <p>&#34;My freshman year I took the Intro to EHS course with Mr. William Hill because I needed an elective. That random class has changed my entire life and helped me find a career and future that I am not only good at, but I am passionate and proud to be practicing in this field. I am teaching and helping employees to work safely so they can have a better tomorrow.&#34;
