  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    I have passion for core public health and these programs are core functions.  I like all of the programs that I manage but if I have to pick one, it would have to be Environmental Health.  I have worked in Environmental Health both in the public and private sectors for 20 years.  Our Environmental Health program is unique for a piedmont North Carolina county because we have a solid mosquito control program and have had one for over 40 years.  Our newest Board of Health adopted mosquito control program dates back to 2003.  I really enjoy managing this team, especially this mosquito control program.

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
    The broad spectrum of courses allows the EH professional to develop a clear mindset of what Environmental Health means.  EH is a very broad science and in order to manage an Environmental Health program, the EH professional must have a good understanding of many sciences.  This program prepared me for a career in managing a program because of this bigger picture approach.  Daily, I may deal with a management decision dealing with a food vendor that is doing specialized processes, a plan for mosquito control to control the potential transmission of mosquito borne disease, or the quarantine of an unvaccinated dog or cat that has been potentially exposed to rabies just to name a few.  This program taught me how to conduct research and not to jump too quickly to conclusions, but to base decisions on science.  The support from my instructors was wonderful.  They challenged me throughout the program, but sincerely wanted me to succeed.  Within nine months after graduation, I found a new job with much more responsibility and more challenges that would not have been possible without the ECU education.
