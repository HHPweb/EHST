  <p><strong>What do you like most about your career?</strong><br>
    &quot;The variety of my job is the most valuable part of my career since it keeps the job fresh and there is always a new challenge to tackle.  Working in a university setting presents many challenges since it is composed of so many different jobs, departments, and research disciplines.  There is always something going on to keep you busy and thinking, and you also have the chance to interact with many different people through the hierarchy of the university.  I also enjoy HAZMAT response since each spill is a different challenge, and you can learn something from each event.  You never want to have a spill, but when these unfortunate events occur, there is an adrenaline rush that comes with the preparation for the specific spill and the clean-up process.&quot;

  <p><strong>How do you think your ECU EH education prepared you for your career?</strong><br>
    &quot;The MSEH program prepared me for my career by exposing me to real world scenarios in the classroom and also providing an internship that gave me work experience before I graduated.  My thesis gave me the opportunity to work with individuals from the Public Health sector since I conducted mosquito research in Pitt County.  The program also gave me the credentials and opportunity teach which I use as a way to give back to the department, and share some of the ‘real world’ experiences I have had during my career.   In the end the MSEH gave me a well-rounded education and provided me with a wide variety of experiences that equipped me for almost anything in my future career as an Environmental Health Professional.&quot;
